# Machine learning
This repository contains my machine learning practice as guided by the 'Python Machine Learning' book by Sebastian 
Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili.

## ML classifier types

| Name | Type | Activation function | Cost function | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------ | :------------ | :--- | :--- |
| Perceptron | Binary classifier; single layer neural network | None | None | Guaranteed to converge if classes are linearly separable | Only converges if classes are linearly separable and learning rate is low enough |
| Adaptive linear neuron | Binary classifier; single layer neural network | Linear | Sum of squared errors | An improvement on the perceptron |
| Logistic regression | Binary classifier; single layer neural network | Sigmoid | Logistic cost function (log-likelihood) | | Gives 'probabilities' as well as predictions |

## Cost minimisation methods
* Gradient descent (or batch gradient descent)
* Stochastic gradient descent
* Mini-batch gradient descent

## Feature scaling methods
* Standardisation
